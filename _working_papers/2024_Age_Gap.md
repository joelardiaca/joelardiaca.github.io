abstract: 'This study examines the age gap in political interest, exploring the possibility that the observed differences between age groups arise from the broad, unspecified nature of survey questions that refer generically to "politics." A randomized survey experiment asked about political interest in general (control) or prompted individuals with youth-centric issues in Spain (housing, labor precarity), traditional topics (elections, parties), and contemporary issues (climate change, gender equality). Results show youth-centric topics significantly reduce the age gap, while traditional issues widen it. Contemporary issues had little effect. These findings suggest surveys should include a broader range of issues to avoid overstating younger generations’ political disengagement, and political discourse should align with relevant topics to engage younger audiences more effectively.'
